## Git Best Practices
* Commit early and often
* Keep branches short-lived (merge often)
* Keep branches up-to-date (pull often)
* Rebase when possible
* Enforce naming standards

More on [git best practices](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#commit).

## Standards
* Capitalise subject line in commit messages
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use imperative mood in commit messages
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Use a body

The commit should look like this:

```
<title>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```


Git uses capitalisation and the imperative mood when merging or reverting, so that's what we use:


__Good__ `Add validation error msg`

__Bad__ `adding validation error msg`


Some people prefer to use _lowercase_. This works well with _labels_, for example:


`docs(changelog): update change log to beta.5`


A handy table for labels:

| Label | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| feat | A new feature |
| fix | A bug fix |
| style | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| perf | A code change that improves performance |
| test| Adding missing or correcting existing tests |
| chore| Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation |
| doc | Documentation only changes |

The above information comes from Angular's [commit standards and guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


You should also use a _body_ to explain what the commit does. A good idea is to references the JIRA / Github issue, for example:

```
fix: validation on text input

This fixes the validation on the text input, broken in commit a05bcd3.

Closes SEWA-104.
```

You can set up your editor to open a standard template on commit. Find instructions [here](#template).

### Naming Branches
* Prefix with feature or fix labels;
* Use lowercase;
* Include JIRA issue;
* Separate words with either slash, underscore or hyphen (avoid mixing and matching...).


__Good__ `feat/SEWA-104/react-barcodes`

__Bad__ `feat_SEWA_104_React-barcodes_Step-2`


## Setup
#### Configure git to open your default editor on every commit:

```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
git config --global core.editor "vim"
```

#### Use a template for your commit messages
Create a file called `~/.gitmessage.txt` in your home directory with the following content:

```
Subject line
<blank line>
Body.
[JIRA-XXX]
```

Tell git to use it:

`git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt`

#### Ignore Files
You can ignore files locally or globally by adding them to:

* your repo's `.git/info/excludesfile`
* a local `.gitignore`
* your `.gitignore_global` in your home directory

Then point the `core.excludesfile` setting in your `.gitconfig` to it:

```
[user]
	name = Kitty
	email = kitty@ticketmaster.co.uk
[core]
	excludesfile = /Users/kitty/.gitignore_global
```

The `.gitignore_global`:

```
npm-debug.log
node_modules
coverage
.DS_Store
```

## Git by Tasks
### Commit Code
The first commit of a repository can not be rebased like regular commits, so
it’s good practice to create an empty commit as your repository root:

`git commit -m “root" --allow-empty`

Amend the latest message, if you haven’t pushed:

`git commit --amend -m "New commit message"`

If you forgot to add a file to the latest commit, you can still reuse the same
commit message:

`git add filename`
`git commit --amend --no-edit`

### Stash Code
Use stash when you need to do something else quickly, but you are not finished
with what you were doing:

`git add -a`
`git stash`
`git stash apply`

Some cleanup:
`git stash list`
`git stash clear`

`git stash pop` // will apply and delete from the stack

### Inspect your changes
Some tricks for diffing code:

`git diff origin/develop`  // see all changes that we have in our working
directory that develop does not have
`git diff origin/develop <filename>` // can also pass a file name
`git diff HEAD` // compare with staged changes
`git diff -w`   // see changes without indent changes

### Search Code
`git log -3` // show the last 3
`git log --after="2014-7-1"`
`git log --after="yesterday"` // and also "1 week ago" or --before

Examples:
`git log —oneline`
`git log -3`
`git log --author="ericat"`
`git log -p -S"Math"` // code changes that include “Math", the -p also includes the code changes
`git log -p -G <regex>`
`git log --no-merges`
`git log --grep="PD-6300"`
`git log —all --grep="PD-6300"`
`git log --all --oneline --decorate --author="Erica" --since="1.week"`
`git log --author=“Ericat|Keith"`
`git log --grep="JRA-224:"` // Jira label!
`git log — webpack.config.babel.js` // show the history of changes for a particular file. Can omit — if there is no risk of mixing it up with a branch
`git log master..wip-star-items` // see all changes that are contained in wip but not in master.
`git shortlog` // see history without hashes

##### Pagination when logging
When you do `git log` and you can spot a colon : at the bottom, it means you have a series of paginated results. You can navigate these results with:

B (back) 
F (forwards) 

or simply  j k.

You can also search withing the pagination with `/searchterm`

### Some Housekeeping
`git branch --merged master` will list all branches that have already been merged
into `master`.

Delete them:
`git branch --merged develop | grep -v 'master$' | grep -v 'develop$' | xargs git
branch -d`

## Git By Example
#### Switch to previous branch
`git checkout -`

#### Use grep
Find a list of files containing a CSS variable with grep - bonus: open them in vim:

`git grep —name-only \$tint-white | xargs vi`

#### Abort a merge
`git reset --hard HEAD`

Checkout a specific version of a file
`git checkout <hash> -- <file_path>`

#### Show file in other git branch
`git show fe-tests:test/acceptance/sell.js`
`git show fe-tests:test/acceptance/sell.js | bcopy` // copy to clipboard (Mac only)

#### Pick a file from another branch/commit
`git checkout <hash> -- <path_to_file>`

#### Pick a file from another branch/commit - NEW FILE
`git checkout <other_branch> — <path_to_file>`

#### Pick a file from another branch but rename it
`git show <branch>:<path_to_file> > <new_path_to_file>`

#### Find branches who are not yet merged to develop
`git branch --no-merge develop`

#### Find out branch that contain a commit
`git branch -a —contains <hash>`

#### List all dev working on a project
`git shortlog`
`git shortlog -s -n -e`
`git shortlog -sn` // list devs with n of commits

#### See only meaningful changes without whitespace in diffs
`git diff -w`

#### See changed words when editing prose
`git diff --word-diff`

#### View all global settings
`git config --global -l`
`git config --list`

#### Check parent of a merge and files changes
`git show --pretty=raw <hash>`

#### Checking history of a file
`git log -- package.json`
`git blame package.json`
`git blame -L150 package.json`
`git blame -L150,+10 package.json`

#### Find out which remote branch a local branch is tracking
`git branch -vv`

#### Update your remote
`git remote set-url origin <url>`

#### Find the commit where the branch was started
Visually, through the command line:

`git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate`

Through a few other commands:

`git reflog --date=local | grep branchname`

`git cherry -v develop` // finds the diff between your branch and develop

same as:

`git log --oneline feat/JIRA-687-react-input ^develop`

`git log develop..master` // show all commits that your branch have that are not yet in master

#### Add everything but whitespace changes
`git diff --ignore-all-space | git apply --cached`

#### Find a commit that touches a particular snippet of code

`git grep '<div class="ticket-price-variation">'`

The above will output a list of files that contain a particular snippet. 

#### Need to remove some files from a previous commit

`git reset —soft HEAD^`

#### Checkout a new branch from a hash
If you want to go and checkout and old version of your code, you can do it in another branch:

`git checkout -b test-branch 56a4e5c08`

#### Check if a rebase is in progress
You can check whether a rebase was in process by looking for the directory `.git/rebase-merge/`.

#### See the log for the pulled in changes
`git log upstream/master`

#### Checkout only part of a file
`git checkout -p (<filename>, optional)` // to see individual hunks

For example, this comes useful when you realised you've committed yet another console.log (and you are not using a linter 😛)

#### Some JIRA Help
Find out what changed in the past two weeks (sprint goals?):

`git log --since='2 weeks ago' --oneline`

What have you done last week? #timesheets

`git log --all --oneline  --author="Erica" --since="1.week"`

Grep for a ticket name:

`git log --grep="PD-6300"`
`git log —all --grep="PD-6300"`
